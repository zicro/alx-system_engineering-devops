# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

## Issue Summary:
- **Duration:** 
  - Start Time: January 18, 2024, 02:30 PM (UTC)
  - End Time: January 18, 2024, 05:45 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Service: E-commerce Platform
  - Users Affected: 65% experienced intermittent downtime and slow response times.

## Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection pool exhaustion, leading to a cascading failure in the application layer.

## Timeline:
- **Detection:**
  - January 18, 2024, 02:30 PM (UTC)
  - Detected through a surge in error rates and response time deviations from baseline metrics.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated application logs for anomalies.
  - Assumed an issue with the application layer due to sudden spikes in user activity.
  - Scaled up application instances to handle increased load.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially focused on application layer issues, overlooking the database layer.
  - Assumed increased user activity without considering underlying infrastructure constraints.
- **Escalation:**
  - Escalated to the Database Operations team after realizing the application layer adjustments did not resolve the issue.
- **Resolution:**
  - Identified the root cause as database connection pool exhaustion.
  - Temporarily increased the database connection pool size to alleviate immediate pressure.
  - Implemented a long-term solution by optimizing database queries and increasing the overall connection pool capacity.
  - Monitored system behavior to ensure stability before declaring the incident resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution:
- **Root Cause:**
  - Database connection pool exhaustion caused by a sudden increase in concurrent user requests.
- **Resolution:**
  - Temporarily increased the database connection pool size to mitigate immediate impact.
  - Optimized database queries to reduce load on the database.
  - Permanently increased the overall connection pool capacity.
  - Implemented automated scaling mechanisms for database resources to handle future spikes in traffic.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- **Things to Improve/Fix:**
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to provide early warnings on potential database resource constraints.
  - Implement load testing scenarios to simulate and identify system vulnerabilities under heavy traffic.
  - Conduct regular performance reviews to identify and optimize resource-intensive database queries.

- **Tasks to Address the Issue:**
  - Configure automated scaling for database resources based on traffic patterns.
  - Conduct a thorough review of database schema and indexes for optimization opportunities.
  - Implement a comprehensive load testing framework to simulate varying traffic conditions.
  - Enhance documentation for troubleshooting database-related issues and their resolution steps.
  - Schedule a post-incident review meeting to analyze the incident, identify lessons learned, and share insights across teams.

This incident highlights the importance of a holistic approach to system monitoring and the need for anticipating potential bottlenecks in a web stack. By addressing both immediate concerns and implementing long-term solutions, we aim to enhance the overall resilience and performance of our web platform.
